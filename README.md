##How to play?

To win you have to defeat the enemy, destroying the Sauron Tower. If your Town Center is destroyed you will lose. Orcs are like rats, they are a plague! Every minute more and more units will appear by minute, so be fast 
or they will kill you.

In order to defeat the orcs you will have to build your own army and battle against them. In order to do this, you have several actions you can do:

- With villagers you can gather resources. There are 4 resources in the world (gold, stone, wood and food). Each resource is for something different. Remember you can create more villagers in the town center.
- Create your city. Each villager has the ability to create buildings. Each building need some resources to be created, and villagers will need some time to build them. In this buildings you will be able to create
  new units and discover new technologies.
- You can create units to build your army. Every unit is different in some way. In order to build an unit you have to have enough resources to train it and the the corresponding building where this unit can be trained.
- Discovering technologies will give you the possibility of create new powerful units. These technologies cost resources aswell, and they can be discovered in the several buildings you can create in the game.
- Heroes are the most powerful units in the game. They have very high stats plus they have powerful and personal skills to destroy the enemies. Use the skill with the button placed on the left-bottom corner.
- During the game you will have quests. These quests will give you a reward that will give you some advantadge. The quests are displayed in the screen.
