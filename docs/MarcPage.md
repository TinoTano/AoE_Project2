## About me
I'm a ninteen year-old student at UPC. 
## What did I do?
I was the Team Leader and Manager of my team so basically I did all the tasks calendar and distribution.  
Here is the [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4NVTL2J00E4aUtjZE1icFUwRXc?usp=sharing) of the gantt chart, task distribution and estimated time for each team member.
Also, I was in charge of basically 4 main tasks:
  
Fog of War
