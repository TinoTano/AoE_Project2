Age of the Ring is a PC strategy game featuring an Age of Empires 2 based gameplay inside the Lord of the Rings environment, with lots of new content to provide players an amazing experience like never before.

Feel the fierce battles of the trilogy between the Free people and the Sauron army during the game campaign and play with the heroes of the middle earth.

# The game

Age Of The Ring relies on the classic gameplay of Age Of Empires mixed with the wonderful world by J.R.R. Tolkien, from the Lord Of The Rings series.
Just like the original AoE games, players can build units and create buildings to have a proper army to defeat your enemies. The player can decide their strategy: more villagers to have more early resources, creating many weak units or research technologies to get better units/heroes...

## How to install?

To play you only have to execute the ".exe" inside the game. It may happen that the antivirus blocks the game. Don't worry, this is because we need to unzip the animation video of the beginning. If it's not
a problem and you have this problem, stop your antivirus for a minute. Thank you ;)

## Controls:

- Left click on unit to select.
- Left click + drag to create an area to selec all units inside this area. 
- Right click to move selected unit to destination. The destination can be a resource, enemy or a building.
- Q for selecting all the war units.
- W for selecting all the villagers
- E for moving the camera to the Town Center.
- SPACEBAR for activing the hero skill (the hero or heroes must be selected).
- All the actions are accesed by the game HUD. Villagers have a button to build and heroes have a button to activate the hero skill.

## How to play?

To win you have to defeat the enemy, destroying the Sauron Tower. If your Town Center is destroyed or you have no units and no resources to create more units you will lose. 

Orcs are like rats, they are a plague! Every minute more and more units will appear by minute, so be fast or they will kill you!

In order to defeat the orcs you will have to build your own army and battle against them. In order to do this, you have several actions you can do:

- With villagers you can gather resources. There are 4 resources in the world (gold, stone, wood and food). Each resource is for something different. Remember you can create more villagers in the town center.
- Create your city. Each villager has the ability to create buildings. Each building need some resources to be created, and villagers will need some time to build them. In this buildings you will be able to create
  new units and discover new technologies.
- You can create units to build your army. Every unit is different in some way. In order to build an unit you have to have enough resources to train it and the the corresponding building where this unit can be trained.
- Discovering technologies will give you the possibility of create new powerful units. These technologies cost resources aswell, and they can be discovered in the several buildings you can create in the game.
- Heroes are the most powerful units in the game. They have very high stats plus they have powerful and personal skills to destroy the enemies. Use the skill with the button placed on the left-bottom corner or with the spacebar.
  Heroes are created in their own buildings too.
- When you start the game you will have two hidden quests. Locate the secret spots to unlock these quests. The information on how to complete these quests will be in the game. The rewards are tasty, so don't miss them!
