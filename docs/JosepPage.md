Josep Huguet, born in 1997. Nineteen year-old student at UPC.

## What did I do?
I was in charge of the whole UI system with help of XML: Images, buttons, texts, etc. Also created the scene manager that holds the scenes.

The resource system, the menu, the surrender menu and the population/building cap.

A whole button system that automatically changes on each building or unit. With visual information when the mouse interacts with them.

Also for Hero skills, when the cooldown bar is full the hero skill button appears. Also, you can see how the stats of what you have selected appears on screen.

You can select multiple units too.

I took part in huge part of the game design and tech development. Here are some charts of what I designed, including the whole technology system and how everything can be gotten from which building, etc.
This was done on top of Rodrigo's previous design but it was reworked because we needed to simplify. So using the tech concept and the units/buildings we had this was done:

Safe/Load was done with Marc and Adri√†.

I did the Settings window with the mute and the fullscreen and made them work.

And also did the particle system that takes care of shooting arrows to targets.
